    "# Loan Default Risk Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will prepare a report for the loan department of a bank. The objective is to determine whether a client's **marital status** and **number of children** influence the likelihood of defaulting on a loan. The bank already has historical data on its clients' creditworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis will support the development of a **credit scoring system** to evaluate the risk profile of potential borrowers. Credit scoring is an essential tool used to assess an applicant's ability to repay a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the data, I’ll clearly define the project’s goals and the hypotheses I intend to test. Throughout this notebook, I will explain my reasoning and decisions to make the report understandable for future collaborators or team members.\n"

    "## Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, my goal was to assess whether factors such as **number of children**, **marital status**, **income level**, and **loan purpose** had any significant correlation with **loan delinquency**. After performing thorough data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis, several patterns emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Children**: Families with at least one child showed a slightly higher delinquency rate (9.2%) compared to those without children (7.5%). This suggests a modest association between having children and financial risk, possibly due to increased household expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marital Status**: Married clients had a delinquency rate of 8.2%, while divorced and widowed clients showed lower rates (7.1% and 6.5%, respectively). This could reflect differences in financial responsibility or available household income after separation or loss of a partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Income Level**: Interestingly, clients with **medium income** had the highest delinquency rate (8.5%), compared to **low income** (6.2%) and **high income** (7.2%). While counterintuitive at first glance, this may point to medium-income clients being more exposed to credit or loans relative to their financial buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loan Purpose**: Clients who took loans for **education** (9.2%) and **car purchases** (9.3%) had the highest delinquency rates. Those who borrowed for **weddings** had a slightly lower rate (8.0%), and **real estate purchases** showed the lowest (7.2%). These findings suggest that borrowing for appreciating assets (like real estate) may be less risky than for depreciating assets or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "While none of the analyzed features alone can definitively predict delinquency, together they offer valuable indicators for assessing risk. These insights can help improve the **credit scoring model** by integrating categorical and behavioral patterns into a more nuanced and robust risk assessment tool. "
