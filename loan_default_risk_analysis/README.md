# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes loan application data to investigate the relationship between client characteristics and loan default behavior. The goal is to identify patterns that help financial institutions assess **creditworthiness** and **reduce risk** when granting loans.

By cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset, we aim to extract insights that explain what types of clients are more likely to default, based on features such as income level, family status, number of children, and the purpose of the loan.

Although the results of the project may be used for further analysis, the main goal of it was to do a pre-processation of given data.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized data about individuals who applied for a loan, including:

- Personal attributes (age, gender, education, family status)
- Financial indicators (income, employment days)
- Loan details (purpose of the loan, repayment status)

## 🔍 Key Findings and conclusions

- Families with children had a slightly higher default rate (9.2%) than those without (7.5%).
- Married clients showed the lowest default rate (8.2%), while divorced and widowed clients were around 7.1% and 6.5%, respectively.
- Income level had a slight correlation:
  - Low income: 6.2%
  - Medium income: 8.5%
  - High income: 7.2%
- Loan purpose also influenced the default rate:
  - Car purchases: 9.3%
  - Education: 9.2%
  - Weddings: 8.0%
  - Real estate: 7.2%
